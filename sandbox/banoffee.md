# Banoffee Pie Recipe

## Ingredients
- 1 can (14 oz) sweetened condensed milk (for caramel)
- 1 1/2 cups (150g) digestive biscuits or graham cracker crumbs

- 3-4 ripe bananas
- 1 1/2 cups (360ml) heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons powdered sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions
1. **Make the caramel (dulce de leche):** Place the unopened can of sweetened condensed milk in a pot of boiling water. Boil for 2 to 3 hours, ensuring the can is always submerged in water. Let it cool before opening.
2. **Prepare the crust:** Crush the digestive biscuits into fine crumbs. Mix with melted butter until well combined. Press the mixture evenly into the base of a 9-inch (23 cm) pie dish. Chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.
3. **Add the caramel:** Spread the cooled caramel over the chilled biscuit base.
4. **Add bananas:** Slice the bananas and layer them evenly on top of the caramel.
5. **Whip the cream:** Whip the heavy cream with powdered sugar and vanilla extract until soft peaks form.
6. **Top the pie:** Spread the whipped cream over the bananas.
7. **Garnish:** Sprinkle with grated chocolate or cocoa powder.
8. **Chill:** Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.
